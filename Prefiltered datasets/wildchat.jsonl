We are reaching new heights in airport boarding.\nEvery year, more than 100 million passengers pass through Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly airports.\n\nIn 2009, the airports’ owner – the ADP Group – introduced PARAFE fingerprint recognition technology to speed up the process. However, only 4% of people could use it, as access to fingerprint biometrics was protected within the passports chip. And there was often confusion among users. Which finger? Which hand?\n\nIn 2017, the airport authorities decided to upgrade PARAFE with facial recognition systems provided by Gemalto. The new system, which comprises 105 smart gates, delivers the following benefits:\n\nMORE USERS:\nAlmost half of the travelers have passports compatible with facial biometrics.\n\nLESS ACTION REQUIRED\nFacial recognition requires virtually no effort from the subject.\n\nFAST AND ACCURATE MATCHES\nThe average processing time per passenger is twice as fast as fingerprint scanning – not subject to passenger error. In the pilot study, boarding times were reduced by between 30% and 40%.\n\nOf course, the new systems complement ‘human’ security measures. Border police can still monitor passengers in real-time, make random checks, and block the opening of gates.\n\nSince 2018, many more airlines have started to use onboard facial recognition technology. In the US alone, more than 15 airports have set up face-matching systems to help board passengers faster and more safely. Trials have occurred at Los Angeles and San Jose airports, among many others.\n\nThe technology is creating a lot of interest in Europe too.\n\nFor example, the airport specialist Amadeus has successfully tested facial recognition technology for flights operated by Adria Airways, Air France, and LOT Polish Airlines at Ljubljana airport.\n\nIt found that introducing biometrics has also cut the average boarding time. The trial was conducted across 15 flights on which 175 passengers volunteered to enroll with their passport or ID card and a selfie check.'\n\nThe live picture was sent to a server and then used to match the passenger when they passed in front of the camera at the departure gate.\n\nIt took fewer than two seconds. With this simple enrolment of their data by smartphone, 98% of passengers were matched successfully and able to board their flight.", "detection_response": [{"entity_type": "GEOLOCATION", "text": "Paris-Charles de Gaulle", "variants": ["Paris-Charles de Gaulle"]}, {"entity_type": "GEOLOCATION", "text": "Paris-Orly", "variants": ["Paris-Orly"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "ADP Group", "variants": ["ADP Group"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "Gemalto", "variants": ["Gemalto"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "Amadeus", "variants": ["Amadeus"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "Adria Airways", "variants": ["Adria Airways"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "Air France", "variants": ["Air France"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "LOT Polish Airlines", "variants": ["LOT Polish Airlines"]}, {"entity_type": "GEOLOCATION", "text": "Ljubljana", "variants": ["Ljubljana"]}, {"entity_type": "GEOLOCATION", "text": "US", "variants": ["US"]}, {"entity_type": "GEOLOCATION", "text": "Los Angeles", "variants": ["Los Angeles"]}, {"entity_type": "GEOLOCATION", "text": "San Jose", "variants": ["San Jose"]}], "filtered_response": {"results": []}, "pii_dict": {"Paris-Charles de Gaulle": "GEOLOCATION", "Paris-Orly": "GEOLOCATION", "ADP Group": "AFFILIATION", "Gemalto": "AFFILIATION", "Amadeus": "AFFILIATION", "Adria Airways": "AFFILIATION", "Air France": "AFFILIATION", "LOT Polish Airlines": "AFFILIATION", "Ljubljana": "GEOLOCATION", "US": "GEOLOCATION", "Los Angeles": "GEOLOCATION", "San Jose": "GEOLOCATION"}, "pii_count": 12, "variants_map": {"Paris-Charles de Gaulle": ["Paris-Charles de Gaulle"], "Paris-Orly": ["Paris-Orly"], "ADP Group": ["ADP Group"], "Gemalto": ["Gemalto"], "Amadeus": ["Amadeus"], "Adria Airways": ["Adria Airways"], "Air France": ["Air France"], "LOT Polish Airlines": ["LOT Polish Airlines"], "Ljubljana": ["Ljubljana"], "US": ["US"], "Los Angeles": ["Los Angeles"], "San Jose": ["San Jose"]}, "task_category": "Summarization", "redact_map": {"Paris-Charles de Gaulle": "[GEOLOCATION1]", "Paris-Orly": "[GEOLOCATION2]", "ADP Group": "[AFFILIATION1]", "Gemalto": "[AFFILIATION2]", "Amadeus": "[AFFILIATION3]", "Adria Airways": "[AFFILIATION4]", "Air France": "[AFFILIATION5]", "LOT Polish Airlines": "[AFFILIATION6]", "Ljubljana": "[GEOLOCATION3]", "US": "[GEOLOCATION4]", "Los Angeles": "[GEOLOCATION5]", "San Jose": "[GEOLOCATION6]"}, "abstract_map": {"Paris-Charles de Gaulle": "a major international airport in France", "Paris-Orly": "another significant airport in France", "ADP Group": "the organization managing the airports", "Gemalto": "a technology provider", "Amadeus": "an airport technology specialist", "Adria Airways": "an airline", "Air France": "a French airline", "LOT Polish Airlines": "a Polish airline", "Ljubljana": "an airport in Slovenia", "US": "a country in North America", "Los Angeles": "a city in California", "San Jose": "another city in California"}}

In this view, it is not a change in our larynx or the first art that signals the beginning of spoken language.

Here in the image, you can see some examples of the earliest stone tools. These particular examples were found in kenya in africa, and they have been dated using the latest techniques at the age. They are thought to be approximately 1 . 76 million years old. That is an unimaginable long time ago, and long before our own species, homo sapiens walk to the earth. Notice how similar these stone tools are in terms of shape, design, and material. You might be asking yourself how this can be used as evidence for spoken language. In 2012, researchers published a paper entitled stone tools, language, and the brain in human evolution. The paper argues that the stone tools are so similar. Yet they have been found over large parts of africa with age differences of thousands of years. So this seems to be clear evidence that there was some kind of communication, some kind of organized culture. Spoken language would allow these early humans to talk about where to find the best rocks, and also talk about how to make the sharpest and most useful tools by hitting stones together to break off small pieces.

And since history actually happened, it will automatically make your scifi background much more scientifically hard. In other words: Don't Reinvent The Wheel. This can also work in your scifi background's technology levels.\n\nMy standard example is the invention of the telegraph system, as explained in the book The Victorian Internet. It is truly scary how accurately the telegraph predicted many of the exact same problems that happened with the advent of the internet. Disruptive effect on business, rise in the use of secret codes, national governments frantically trying to regulate it and getting all touchy about messages crossing national borders, the appearance of a new high-tech geek culture, crooks using it for totally new methods of scamming people out of their money, it all happened with the telegraph first.\n\nAmusingly, this has happened in the real world. In 1962 Garrett AiResearch was under contract by NASA to help design space suits. After pounding their heads against the wall for a time, it occurred to them that some of the problems they were having might have been already solved. Medieval suits of armor had similar design problems. They contacted the New York Metropolitan Museum, who referred them to the Tower of London. There was the 1520 suit of armor designed for King Henry the VIII, which was designed for foot combat, not horseback. Meaning the armor had no gaps in the covering, necessary for space suit design. The Tower sent Garrett photos and data on the armour, which proved to be invaluable. One NASA engineer supposedly said he wished they’d known about Henry’s armour sooner as it would have saved time and money.\n\nBut science fiction authors should be careful not to fall into the Call a Rabbit a \"Smeerp\" pitfall, or your readers will point their fingers at you and laugh.\"", "detection_response": [{"entity_type": "NAME", "text": "Chris Israel Barker", "variants": ["Chris Israel Barker"]}, {"entity_type": "NAME", "text": "Jeff Greason", "variants": ["Jeff Greason"]}, {"entity_type": "NAME", "text": "RocketCat", "variants": ["RocketCat"]}, {"entity_type": "NAME", "text": "Garrett AiResearch", "variants": ["Garrett AiResearch"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "NASA", "variants": ["NASA"]}, {"entity_type": "GEOLOCATION", "text": "New York Metropolitan Museum", "variants": ["New York Metropolitan Museum"]}, {"entity_type": "GEOLOCATION", "text": "Tower of London", "variants": ["Tower of London"]}, {"entity_type": "NAME", "text": "King Henry the VIII", "variants": ["King Henry the VIII"]}], "filtered_response": {"results": [{"entity_type": "NAME", "text": "King Henry the VIII"}]}, "pii_dict": {"Chris Israel Barker": "NAME", "Jeff Greason": "NAME", "RocketCat": "NAME", "Garrett AiResearch": "NAME", "NASA": "AFFILIATION", "New York Metropolitan Museum": "GEOLOCATION", "Tower of London": "GEOLOCATION"}, "pii_count": 7, "variants_map": {"Chris Israel Barker": ["Chris Israel Barker"], "Jeff Greason": ["Jeff Greason"], "RocketCat": ["RocketCat"], "Garrett AiResearch": ["Garrett AiResearch"], "NASA": ["NASA"], "New York Metropolitan Museum": ["New York Metropolitan Museum"], "Tower of London": ["Tower of London"]}, "task_category": "Summarization", "redact_map": {"Chris Israel Barker": "[NAME1]", "Jeff Greason": "[NAME2]", "RocketCat": "[NAME3]", "Garrett AiResearch": "[NAME4]", "NASA": "[AFFILIATION1]", "New York Metropolitan Museum": "[GEOLOCATION1]", "Tower of London": "[GEOLOCATION2]"}, "abstract_map": {"Chris Israel Barker": "a commentator", "Jeff Greason": "an expert", "RocketCat": "a fictional character", "Garrett AiResearch": "a company", "NASA": "a space agency", "New York Metropolitan Museum": "a major museum", "Tower of London": "a historic site"}}

By exploring the potential benefits and challenges associated with integrating aerobic training into rehabilitation protocols, this study aims to contribute valuable insights that can inform more effective and targeted interventions for recovering individuals affected by the new coronavirus. (You, Z., 2020). The experimental method was used for this study. [4] They selected seventy patients with new coronary pneumonia cured from 12/2019 to 04/2020 for the experiment. The participants were 40 males and 30 females, with an average age of 36.1 ± 3.6. The groups were divided into two groups: 35 people were used in the experimental section and 35 in the control section. The only task carried through the control group was a routine recovery procedure with light to moderate aerobics. They used the “National Standards for Mass Aerobics Exercise” (Riya Gupta et al., 2023) for the fitness test. The step test index and vital capacity (VC) were used for this study. After the four weeks of testing, the capacity of the lungs from the experimental section was enhanced by 7.2% ± 1.1% compared to pre-training, and the capacity of the lungs from the control section was improved by 3.9% ± 1.6% compared to pre-training. The lung capacity increase in the experimental section presented higher than the control section’s capacity. While performing the step test index of the experimental group, it showed 1.17 ± 0.31 higher than the control group, which had presented the number 1.02  ±  0.11. The results are given to be statistically significant at a value of P<.05. As they used the “National Standards for Mass Aerobic Exercise,” the effect of the exercise score for the experimental section showed 89.627 ± 5.44 more significant than the control section, which was 76.12 ± 7.81; the results showed a value of P<.05. Aerobics training was offered to be effective when helping patients with coronary pneumonia recover respiratory endurance.

In response, the colonists staged protests and riots. After a tax was put on tea in 1773, several Boston men dressed up as Indigenous Americans and boarded British tea ships. They threw the tea into Boston harbor to protest the tax. In response, the British announced the Coercive Acts in 1774. These were also known as the Intolerable Acts. These laws closed Boston’s harbor, restricted local elections, and expanded the power of the royal governor. In April 1775, fighting broke out between British and American troops in Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts.\n\nDuring the Second Continental Congress in 1776, the representatives of the colonies adopted the Declaration of Independence. It announced that the United States was its own nation and listed the natural rights of mankind. In 1778, the French government allied itself with the revolutionaries against the British, and other countries soon joined in. The British were forced to recognize the independence of the 13 colonies in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. The United States was formed and structured as a representative democracy.\n\nAmerican revolutionaries rejected the authority of the king, in part, based on the idea that all people were equal.\nEven after revolution, though, deep inequalities remained.

Do you know how they say entps change majors in college and don't stay focused on long term plans? Well, I took that to an extreme. I'm smart but am not the greatest student, especially at extremely high levels of academics. So because of that, I fell into the trap of doing more school because I was mediocre at school.  I got into a top 10 US law school and graduated with a JD but didn't have the greatest grades. I tried to interview at large firms throughout my entire time in law school, and nothing really panned out. For a month after passing the bar exam I was unemployed, and I got really frustrated. I was surprised that I really was so unemployable despite having graduated from law school. I was frustrated with the profession and impulsively decided to leave.  During COVID, universities started offering everything online, so while working part time jobs remotely, I finished all the pre-reqs for med school and hyperfocused on studying for the MCAT by watching YouTube videos. I actually did really well and got admitted to a US med school despite having no formal science training.  But then med school was extremely different from what I expected. It was mostly mountains of rote memorization, often times without even understanding the underlying concepts. It seemed the complete opposite of my personality, and I really struggled during that time. I ultimately decided to leave because I didn't want to dedicate another decade of my life to a career I realized was completely different. It was a bad fit for me.  So I decided to just try to find a job and start working. I figured I am relatively smart and could find something. But nope, unemployed. People view all my time prepping for med school and being in med school as an employment gap. And law firms aren't too receptive to me either.  I can reasonably sell myself as interested in law, but other fields are confused about my path. I feel like I invested so much into school, something I don't even like very much, only to have significantly hurt my career.

staff, equipment and property to the province by the end of the year.\n\nLaGrange did not discuss the cost of the deal, saying there is a memorandum of understanding with Dynalife and those details are still being hashed out.\n\nUnder the deal, the Dynalife operation will be taken over by Alberta Precision Laboratories, which is part of Alberta Health Services and has been handling more community lab work from Dynalife in recent weeks.\n\nLaGrange says during the transition there will be no impact on Albertans and they will still be able to get their testing done by the same people at the same locations.\n\nThe Opposition NDP says the entire affair is a mess of the United Conservative Party government’s making, noting the UCP moved in 2019 to fully privatize community lab

Background\nHepatitis B and C viruses are the major public health concerns of the globe. The two hepatotropic viruses share common modes of transmission and their co-infection is common. Despite the provision of an effective prevention mechanism, the infections caused by these viruses remain a significant problem worldwide, particularly among developing countries like Ethiopia Methods\nThis institutional-based retrospective study was conducted between January 2014\nDecember and December 2019 from documented laboratory logbooks of Adigrat general hospital serology laboratory, Tigrai, Ethiopia. data were collected and checked for completeness on a daily based, coded, entered, and cleaned using Epinfo version 7.1, exported and analyzed using SPSS version 23. Binary logistic regression analysis and Chi-square test (X2) assessed the association between dependent and independent variables. The corresponding variables with a P-value (P <0.05) and 95% confidence interval were considered statistically significant.\nResults\nOut of 20,935 clinically suspected individuals, 20,622 were given specimens and tested for hepatitis B and C viruses with total completeness of 98.5%. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus was found to be 3.57% (689/19,273) and 2.13% (30/1,405), respectively. The positivity rate of the hepatitis B virus was 8.0% (106/1317) and 3.24% (583/17,956) among males and females, respectively. Additionally, 2.49%( 12/481) of males and 1.94% (18/924) of females were positive for hepatitis C virus fection. The overall prevalence of co-infection for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus was 7.4% (4/54). Sex and age were significantly associated with hepatitis B and C virus infection.\nConclusions\nThe overall prevalence of hepatitis B and C is low intermediate according to the WHO criteria. Although there was a fluctuating trend of hepatitis B and C through the years\n2014-2019, the result shows moreover declining trend. Both hepatitis B and C share similar routes of transmission and affect all age categories but males were more highly affected than females.

However, considering the unique nature of expatriate teaching positions, it is possible that he/she may not have direct housing purchase needs during his/her work period in Guangzhou. Therefore, our school usually opts to provide housing allowances to ensure his/her quality of life in the city.\n\nFor expatriates who have obtained China's \"Permanent Residence Permit for Foreigners,\" based on the latest \"Regulations on the Management of Housing Fund\" and relevant policies in the work location, our school is willing to discuss with you whether to contribute to the housing fund. However please kindly note that this is not a mandatory requirement for our school.\n\nTaking the above into consideration, we have specifically offered the following three options for your further reference and selection:\n\n(1) If you choose to continue receiving the housing allowance provided by our school, we will not purchase housing fund on your behalf.\n(2) If you are interested in contributing to the housing fund, our school will withhold and contribute on your behalf at a rate of 8% per month, using a contribution base of RMB 2,300 per month. This means you will need to bear approximately RMB 180 per month in personal contributions. However, please note that once you choose this option, you will no longer receive the housing allowance from our school.\n(3) If you wish to contribute to the housing fund while maintaining the housing allowance from our school, our school will deduct the amount of your personal housing fund contribution from your monthly housing allowance, which amounts to approximately RMB 180 per month.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you can choose the most suitable option based on your actual situation and needs. If you have any questions or require further explanations and assistance, please feel free to contact us.

Herbal medicines have been widely used in the treatment of neurological disorders due to their multi-target and multi-pathway characters. Ginkgo biloba Leaves (GBLs) previously been found to have therapeutic effects on NDs. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of GBLs in the treatment of NDs have not been systematically summarized. \nObjective: The purpose of this study is to comprehensively summarize the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of GBLs in some NDs through systematic analysis.\nMethods: Databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, and Web of Science were retrieved, and PRISMA 2020 guidelines were used to build the review. The data in these reports were extracted to analyze the protective effects and pharmacological mechanisms of GBLs in the treatment of NDs.\nResults: The 52 studies related to the treatment of NDs with GBLs were screened out after excluding records that did not meet the inclusion criteria, including 39 preclinical trials and 13 clinical studies. The top five types of NDs associated with GBLs in these items were Depression, Alzheimer's disease, Stroke, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease.\nConclusion: This is the first study to systematically evaluate the pharmacological effects and neuroprotective mechanisms of GBLs in the treatment of ND. Research shows that GBLs can improve memory, cognition, behavior and psychopathology. This article reviews the protective effects of GBLs as herbal medicines in NDs and their identified or possible molecular mechanisms of action, and also emphasizes the clinical significance of GBLs. In addition, analysis of these 47 data found that GBLs provide therapeutic or palliative effects on NDs mainly through free radical scavenging, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory response, mitochondrial protection, neurotransmitter regulation, and antagonism of PAF. This study will help to better understand the efficacy and complexity of GBLs in treating NDs and provide detailed references and recommendations for the research of this herbal medicines in NDs.\n", "detection_response": [{"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "PubMed", "variants": ["PubMed"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "Google Scholar", "variants": ["Google Scholar"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "CNKI", "variants": ["CNKI"]}, {"entity_type": "AFFILIATION", "text": "Web of Science", "variants": ["Web of Science"]}, {"entity_type": "TIME", "text": "PRISMA 2020", "variants": ["PRISMA 2020"]}], "filtered_response": {"results": []}, "pii_dict": {"PubMed": "AFFILIATION", "Google Scholar": "AFFILIATION", "CNKI": "AFFILIATION", "Web of Science": "AFFILIATION", "PRISMA 2020": "TIME"}, "pii_count": 5, "variants_map": {"PubMed": ["PubMed"], "Google Scholar": ["Google Scholar"], "CNKI": ["CNKI"], "Web of Science": ["Web of Science"], "PRISMA 2020": ["PRISMA 2020"]}, "task_category": "Edit Text", "redact_map": {"PubMed": "[AFFILIATION1]", "Google Scholar": "[AFFILIATION2]", "CNKI": "[AFFILIATION3]", "Web of Science": "[AFFILIATION4]", "PRISMA 2020": "[TIME1]"}, "abstract_map": {"PubMed": "a widely used medical database", "Google Scholar": "a comprehensive academic search engine", "CNKI": "a major Chinese academic database", "Web of Science": "a multidisciplinary research database", "PRISMA 2020": "a set of guidelines for systematic reviews"}}

Additionally, if we consider the fact that this individual's vice-presidential running mate in 1856 was William A.

Strategy 2: The question asks for a person who had debates with Stephen Douglas, which is not the same as the person who debated with Douglas in 1858. Strategy 3: The question introduces an irrelevant fact about the vice-presidential running mate. Strategy 4: The question contradicts itself by first asking for the person who debated with Douglas and then specifying that it was in 1858, which is the year of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, not the debates with the person's own running mate. Additionally, the mention of the Know-Nothing movement is an attempt to distract and complicate the question.\n\nAn ideal answer would first clarify that the person being asked about is Abraham Lincoln, who debated with Stephen Douglas in 1858.

Physical chemistry, as it is practiced in the modern world, is concerned principally with pharmaceutical or industrial research projects. It is confined within the boundaries of an all-pervading materialism, which binds labor to the advancement of physical objectives. (Manly Palmer Hall)\n4. Chemistry has been termed by the physicist as the messy part of physics, but that is no reason why the physicists should be permitted to make a mess of chemistry when they invade it.

While I think of it in your letter you refer to a report published in the 6th monthly Magazine for August ’15, will you send me a copy, as I have not seen it.\n\nWell, we have had about the biggest gruelling we could wish for. The Huns bombarded us in the trenches for over two hours with Jack Johnson* shells, shrapnel, whizz bangs* (terrible things) and trench mortars, blew the parapets to blazes and nearly blew the whole lot of us up. The General Officer Commanding has complimented us on our behaviour. We are now resting at a place called Vlamertinghe, just south of Ypres and a couple miles North of Poperinghe [Poperinge] in Belgium. We deserve a rest for we have spent thirty-nine days in dugouts and the trenches (except three days) and needless to tell you we are very crummy, which tends to spoil the rest we are having. I never thought I was going to another phase of them after South Africa. I was in Poperinghe (where I met Jackson a few weeks ago)…\n\nThe beauty of it out here is we can stand a pal a drink, and also have one with him. I suppose shall have to wait for my increase, being an absentee from the office, anyway they can add it on to my salary as soon as they like for I shall then be able to pay more income tax. I enclose a few postcards. They are showing in each card before and after, or during and after the bombardment of Ypres, so you can guess what the place looks like. Well Bert in conclusion I must tell you that one of our Sergeants who is on leave, posted this in London for me, that’s why I am able to give you a few details.
