His two adolescent children have also got admission in one of the best public schools of the town. After settling down in his appointment as Director in the Home Department of the State, Ramesh got confidential report through intelligence sources that illegal migrants are infiltrating in the State from the neighbouring country. He decided to personally carry out surprise check of the border posts along with his Home Department team. To his surprise, he caught red-handed two families of 12 members infiltrated with the connivance of the security personnel at the border posts. On further inquiry and investigation, it was found that after the migrants from neighbouring country infiltrate, their documentation like Aadhaar Card, Ration Card and Voter Card are also forged and they are made to settle down in a particular area of the State. Ramesh prepared the detailed and comprehensive report and submitted to the Additional Secretary of the State. However, he has summoned by the Additional Home Secretary after a week and was instructed to withdraw the report. The Additional Home Secretary informed Ramesh that the report submitted by him has not been appreciated by the higher authorities. He further cautioned him that if he fails to withdraw the confidential report, he will not only be posted out from the prestigious appointment from the State capital but his further promotion which is due in near future will also get in jeopardy.\n(a) What are the Department options available to Ramesh as the Director of the Home Department of the bordering State?\n(b) What option should Ramesh adopt and why?\n(c) Critically evaluate each of the options.\n(d) What are the ethical dilemmas being faced by Ramesh?\n(e) What policy measures would you suggest to combat the menace of infiltration of illegal migrants from the neighbouring country?", "pii_dict": {"Ramesh": "NAME", "State Civil Services Officer": "OCCUPATION", "Director in the Home Department": "OCCUPATION", "Additional Secretary": "OCCUPATION", "Additional Home Secretary": "OCCUPATION", "cancer": "HEALTH_INFORMATION", "admission": "EDUCATIONAL_RECORD"}, "pii_count": 8, "variants_map": {"Ramesh": ["Ramesh"], "State Civil Services Officer": ["State Civil Services Officer"], "Director in the Home Department": ["Director in the Home Department"], "Additional Secretary": ["Additional Secretary"], "Additional Home Secretary": ["Additional Home Secretary"], "cancer": ["cancer"], "admission": ["admission"]}, "redact_map": {"Ramesh": "[NAME1]", "State Civil Services Officer": "[OCCUPATION1]", "Director in the Home Department": "[OCCUPATION2]", "Additional Secretary": "[OCCUPATION3]", "Additional Home Secretary": "[OCCUPATION4]", "cancer": "[HEALTH_INFORMATION1]", "admission": "[EDUCATIONAL_RECORD1]"}, "abstract_map": {"Ramesh": "an individual", "State Civil Services Officer": "a government position", "Director in the Home Department": "a leadership role in a government department", "Additional Secretary": "a senior government official", "Additional Home Secretary": "a high-ranking official in the Home Department", "cancer": "a serious illness", "admission": "enrollment"}, "task_category": "Answering Multiple Choice Questions"}

However, by the time I started this project, the Zillow API had been deprecated, and Apartments.com and Zillow had both put up captchas to disable scraping as well.\n\nI found more housing data on the US 2021 census data website. The census data covers a lot of information, however, that's an aggregated source of data, and so there's no information about particular housing/apartment, but more of the entire region as a whole. Considering that, I chose 6 regions for the project : College Park, Hyattsville, Adelphi, Berwyn Heights, Riverdale Park, and University Park.\n\nIt took a little cleaning and filtering, and the next goal was to present this data in a viable format. I started off with kepler.gl, which meant I needed geojson for each of these areas. Maps usually do not provide geojson for \"areas\", so it took a bunch of scraping the census website (which showed the map in the background) to get that out. Once obtained, I tried to plot the geojson in kepler, but kepler refused to link the data to the geojson. After a couple of tries, I moved to deck.gl, uber's data viz solution. Unfortunately, I was unable to get Deck to work. The map refused to show, and so did the rest of it. After a week to trying that out, I switch to a more manual method. I exported the geojson to svgs, and built out this website with Figma and framer. \n\nUnfortunately, doing data analysis by hand, and extracting important conclusions is a taxing process, which is why only College Park is out and ready to go.\n\nA future possible goal would be to generate trustworthy-ness ratings to housing postings and apartments on the basis of the area and crime rates, and from that, be able to generate a dependable directory of housing accessible to students heading into UMD.

Three final trio episodes will stream Dec. 15, part of a multiyear deal between the couple and the streaming platform.\n\n\"We’ve never been allowed to tell our story,\" Prince Harry, 38, says in the docuseries. \"That’s the consistency.\"\n\nOver three episodes, which build up to the pair's 2018 wedding, the couple share intimate details of their love story, including the moment Harry first laid eyes on Meghan (via Instagram) and details of his proposal. They also address the parts of their history that aren't so charming, like harassment by the media and Harry's abhorrent decision to dress as a Nazi in the mid-2000s. \n\nHere are the revelations about “H” and “M,” as they affectionately call each other.\nPrince Harry feels 'ashamed' for wearing Nazi costume\n\nHarry acknowledges in his family, \"there is a huge level of unconscious bias.\" He reflects on the decision to wear a Nazi uniform to a costume party in 2005, when he was 20 years old.\n\n\"It was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life,\" he says. \"I felt so ashamed afterwards. All I wanted to do was make it right.\"\n\nHarry says a conversation with London's chief rabbi \"had a profound impact.\" He also traveled to Berlin to speak with a Holocaust survivor.\n\n\"I could’ve just ignored it and gone on and probably made the same mistakes over and over again in my life,\" Harry says. \"But I learned from that.\"\nHow Harry proposed to Duchess Meghan, plus an engagement party in penguin onesies\n\nHarry reveals he wanted to pop the question earlier than he did, in November 2017, but \"because I had to ask permission from my grandmother, I couldn’t do it outside of the U.K.\"\n\nOn the special night, Harry popped a magnum of champagne as Duchess Meghan, now 41, roasted a chicken. Then he took her to the garden where he’d set up 15 electric candles, which gave Meghan time to call a friend to whom she excitedly whispered, \"It’s happening! It’s happening! It’s happening! Oh my God. He told me not to peek.\"\nShe says, \"He was down on one knee, and I was just like, 'Yes!' We were so joyful and excited!\"\nThe newly engaged couple were celebrated by friends with an engagement party, where attendants wore animal onesies, friend Lucy Fraser says. \"Meg and Harry were in matching penguin onesies because penguins mate for life, and they were so sweet. And we had so much fun.\"", "pii_dict": {"Netflix": "AFFILIATION", "Duke and Duchess of Sussex": "AFFILIATION", "Thursday": "TIME", "Dec. 15": "TIME", "38": "AGE", "2018": "TIME", "mid-2000s": "TIME", "2005": "TIME", "20": "AGE", "London": "GEOLOCATION", "Berlin": "GEOLOCATION", "November 2017": "TIME", "41": "AGE", "Lucy Fraser": "NAME"}, "pii_count": 8, "variants_map": {"Netflix": ["Netflix"], "Duke and Duchess of Sussex": ["Duke and Duchess of Sussex"], "Thursday": ["Thursday"], "Dec. 15": ["Dec. 15"], "38": ["38"], "2018": ["2018"], "mid-2000s": ["mid-2000s"], "2005": ["2005"], "20": ["20"], "London": ["London"], "Berlin": ["Berlin"], "November 2017": ["November 2017"], "41": ["41"], "Lucy Fraser": ["Lucy Fraser"]}, "redact_map": {"Netflix": "[AFFILIATION1]", "Duke and Duchess of Sussex": "[AFFILIATION2]", "Thursday": "[TIME1]", "Dec. 15": "[TIME2]", "38": "[AGE1]", "2018": "[TIME3]", "mid-2000s": "[TIME4]", "2005": "[TIME5]", "20": "[AGE2]", "London": "[GEOLOCATION1]", "Berlin": "[GEOLOCATION2]", "November 2017": "[TIME6]", "41": "[AGE3]", "Lucy Fraser": "[NAME1]"}, "abstract_map": {"Netflix": "a popular streaming service", "Duke and Duchess of Sussex": "a well-known royal couple", "Thursday": "a day of the week", "Dec. 15": "a specific date in December", "38": "his age at the time", "2018": "the year of their wedding", "mid-2000s": "a period in the early 21st century", "2005": "the year of the incident", "20": "his age during the incident", "London": "the capital city of the United Kingdom", "Berlin": "the capital city of Germany", "November 2017": "the month and year of the proposal", "41": "her age at the time", "Lucy Fraser": "a friend of the couple"}, "task_category": "Edit Text"}

The SDR tasked itself with returning Soviet society and the Soviet state to Leninist principles of organization, which, in their opinion, had been perverted by Stalin’s Bonapartist regime.\n\nOn January 18, 1951, Pechuro was arrested along with the organization’s other members. On February 13, 1952, the Military Collegium of the USSR Supreme Court sentenced Pechuro to 25 years in labor camps on charges of treason and planning the murder of Georgy Malenkov[.] The organization’s three leaders, Boris Slutsky (born 1932), Vladlen Furman (born 1932), and Yevgeny Gurevich (born 1931) were shot.\n\nPechuro served her sentence in various Gulag camps, including camps in Inta, Abez, and Potma. In 1956, the group’s case was reexamined. Pechuro’s sentence was reduced to five years and she was released.\n\nAlthough she passed the entrance exams to Moscow State University’s history department, she was not enrolled. She graduated from the Moscow State Historical Archives Institute.\n\nAt the Historical Archives Institute, Pechuro researched the purges during the reign of Ivan the Terrible. Her work was published in the Proceedings of the Moscow State Historical Archives Institute. In 1961, she successfully defended her thesis, “The Decree Books as a Source on the History of Ivan the Terrible’s Zemshchina,” with Alexander Zimin as her advisor.\n\nPechuro worked in the Archive of Ancient Documents at the Institute for African Studies.\n\nShe was rehabilitated only on July 18, 1989, by the Plenum of the USSR Supreme Court.\n\nA long-time member of Memorial, she signed the“Putin Must Go” petition in 2010.\n\nPechuro died in Moscow on January 1, 2014.

{"index": 69, "conversation_id": "1uSqhEY", "original_message": "Turn this into 15 dot points\n\nThe so-called ‘uniform evidence law’ (or ‘uniform evidence Acts’) presently comprises seven Australian statutes: \n• Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) \n• Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) \n• Evidence Act 2001 (Tas) \n• Evidence Act 2004 (Norfolk Island) 1 \n• Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) \n• Evidence Act 2011 (ACT) \n• Evidence (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011 (NT). \n Despite the latter statute’s (non-uniform) name, the uniform evidence law is not a national law; however, it is easier to list the Australian jurisdictions where such statutes have not been enacted. \n There are just three: Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Although, as Heydon J archly observed in Baker v The Queen , 2 ‘[t] hose polities are very large in area’—indeed, they total nearly 70 per cent of the continent—Australia’s uniform evidence law scheme has clear ‘majority’ status in two respects: \n\n• by jurisdiction, reaching seven out of the nation’s ten court systems \n• by population, now reaching over fi ve out of every eight Australians (ignoring the Commonwealth Act, which applies to federal courts everywhere). \n\n On the other hand, there have been no new Australian entries to the scheme since \nthe Northern Territory’s adoption in 2011. \n\n The non-adopting jurisdictions face a form of limbo, following Australia’s mostly abandoned ‘common law of evidence’, tinkered with by local statutes. But the seven adopting jurisdictions likewise face the prospect of following a revolutionary scheme that has partially stalled. This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions, although it is clear that this task still involves attention to the earlier law (see [ 1.3.2 ] under the heading ‘ Common law ’) and to an increasing set of legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme (see [ 1.2 ], ‘ Uniform law ’.)\n\nThis chapter introduces the uniform evidence law’s basic features. First, it describes the most conservative feature of the scheme: its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law. Second, it describes and assesses the scheme’s goal of a broadly applicable, uniformly developed and easily found Australian evidence law. Finally, it details the connections between the uniform evidence law and other laws:  local statutes, the common law, overseas law and human rights law", "pii_dict": {"Australia": "GEOLOCATION", "Queensland": "GEOLOCATION", "South Australia": "GEOLOCATION", "Western Australia": "GEOLOCATION", "Tas": "GEOLOCATION", "Norfolk Island": "GEOLOCATION", "Vic": "GEOLOCATION", "ACT": "GEOLOCATION", "NT": "GEOLOCATION", "Northern Territory": "GEOLOCATION", "Cth": "GEOLOCATION", "Heydon J": "NAME", "Baker v The Queen": "AFFILIATION", "1995": "TIME", "2001": "TIME", "2004": "TIME", "2008": "TIME", "2011": "TIME"}, "pii_count": 8, "variants_map": {"Australia": ["Australia", "Australian"], "Queensland": ["Queensland"], "South Australia": ["South Australia"], "Western Australia": ["Western Australia"], "Tas": ["Tas"], "Norfolk Island": ["Norfolk Island"], "Vic": ["Vic"], "ACT": ["ACT"], "NT": ["NT"], "Northern Territory": ["Northern Territory"], "Cth": ["Cth"], "Heydon J": ["Heydon J"], "Baker v The Queen": ["Baker v The Queen"], "1995": ["1995"], "2001": ["2001"], "2004": ["2004"], "2008": ["2008"], "2011": ["2011"]}, "redact_map": {"Australia": "[GEOLOCATION1]", "Queensland": "[GEOLOCATION2]", "South Australia": "[GEOLOCATION3]", "Western Australia": "[GEOLOCATION4]", "Tas": "[GEOLOCATION5]", "Norfolk Island": "[GEOLOCATION6]", "Vic": "[GEOLOCATION7]", "ACT": "[GEOLOCATION8]", "NT": "[GEOLOCATION9]", "Northern Territory": "[GEOLOCATION10]", "Cth": "[GEOLOCATION11]", "Heydon J": "[NAME1]", "Baker v The Queen": "[AFFILIATION1]", "1995": "[TIME1]", "2001": "[TIME2]", "2004": "[TIME3]", "2008": "[TIME4]", "2011": "[TIME5]"}, "abstract_map": {"Australia": "a country in the Southern Hemisphere", "Queensland": "a state in northeastern Australia", "South Australia": "a state in southern central Australia", "Western Australia": "a state in the western part of Australia", "Tas": "an Australian island state", "Norfolk Island": "an external territory of Australia", "Vic": "a state in southeastern Australia", "ACT": "a territory in southeastern Australia", "NT": "a territory in central northern Australia", "Northern Territory": "a territory in central northern Australia", "Cth": "the Commonwealth of Australia", "Heydon J": "a former Australian judge", "Baker v The Queen": "a legal case in Australia", "1995": "a year in the late 20th century", "2001": "a year in the early 21st century", "2004": "a year in the early 21st century", "2008": "a year in the early 21st century", "2011": "a year in the early 21st century"}, "task_category": "Edit Text"}

{"index": 78, "conversation_id": "VmLZ5PG", "original_message": "1 / 1rewrite this in a scientific journal format:\n\nAs someone who has always been fascinated by psychological studies, discovering the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) a few years ago did nothing but pique my interest. This self-report questionnaire allows individuals to identify themselves as one of the 16 personalities which differ in qualities like decision making, perspective, tendencies and more. One psychological field that I particularly gravitate towards is called cognitive psychology, which focuses on personal aspects like thinking, creativity, and problem solving. Because I believe that all of these factors play a major role in an individual's educational experience, I came up with a question can a connection be drawn between a student's personality type and their academic tendencies? Many scientists argue that the Myers-Briggs system is pure pseudoscience and should not be taken seriously. For this reason alone, I became even more interested in exploring the possibilities in my own investigation.\nTo gather data and lay the foundations for my research, I conducted a survey asking students to provide their MBTI personality type, their GPA, most and least preferred school subject, and a bit more general info.

{"index": 101, "conversation_id": "yeeEppH", "original_message": "Here is a sample essay written by a student. Write another essay in the same style with the same frequency and type of errors.  \nSample: Communication Strategies across Cultural Borders\nThroughout Karla Scott Research paper “Communication Strategies across Cultural Borders” she articulates the stereotypes that many Black Women have to overcome and their response towards such stereotypes. Scott also argues that Black women’s lived experiences reflect interesting identities situated in contexts with racial and gendered power inequities. Scotts descriptive methods help communicate her argument of cross cultural realities and stereotypes.   \nThe introduction to this research experiment presents information about understanding the communicative strategies that black women used to negotiate identity within everyday activities and experiences in different environments. She goes on to mention the theoretical aspect from Hooks book “Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center” quoting hooks statement behind the titles meaning, “Living as we did- on the edge”, lead to the eye opening reality that they must understanf both aspects of life from the “outside in and from the inside out.” Scott examines the experiences of Black women in predominantly White communities in order to understand and  “liberate” Black women from the negative stereotypes that society has placed on them and their communication strategies, by examining the why and how of their strategies, and the rewarding empowerment that comes from redefining what it means to be Black and a woman in the twenty first century. \nThe experiment reported in this paper (using black women at various stages in their academic careers) are rooted from predominantly white environments where they encounter cross cultural borders and stereotypes such as being “outspoken, angry, gold digger … and intelligent.” Scott began by collecting descriptive communicative experiences from black women. Where many stated that they felt as though they were representatives of their Black Communities and would often change their communication strategies which included tone of voice, body movement, and clothing choice in order to become more successful in such environments. She then continued to ask the participants to recall a specific experience and context where they had to use communication strategies. Which reflected an awareness of historical perceptions of Black womanhood and the result of redefining what it means to be a Black woman by using specific strategies, and the responsibility of providing insights and information to those in predominant white environments of their own culture by creating alternative versions of what it means to be a Black woman.\nScott concludes that the results of the experiment indicate that young black women perceive their communication strategies to be a necessary life skill in order to succeed in such environments as predominant white communities and the importance of being aware of historical perceptions of Black Women and providing “teach- able moments” to those in predominantly white communities. Overall, she argues how those same strategies can be empowered by the experiences of Black womanhood. \nSimilar essay:", "pii_dict": {"Karla Scott": "NAME", "Hooks": "NAME", "Black Communities": "AFFILIATION", "predominantly White communities": "AFFILIATION", "Black Women": "GENDER", "women": "GENDER", "Black": "RACE", "twenty first century": "GEOLOCATION", "academic careers": "EDUCATIONAL_RECORD"}, "pii_count": 8, "variants_map": {"Karla Scott": ["Karla Scott", "Scott"], "Hooks": ["Hooks", "hooks"], "Black Communities": ["Black Communities"], "predominantly White communities": ["predominantly White communities", "predominant white environments", "predominantly white communities"], "Black Women": ["Black Women", "Black women", "Black womanhood", "Black woman"], "women": ["women", "woman"], "Black": ["Black"], "twenty first century": ["twenty first century"], "academic careers": ["academic careers"]}, "redact_map": {"Karla Scott": "[NAME1]", "Hooks": "[NAME2]", "Black Communities": "[AFFILIATION1]", "predominantly White communities": "[AFFILIATION2]", "Black Women": "[GENDER1]", "women": "[GENDER2]", "Black": "[RACE1]", "twenty first century": "[GEOLOCATION1]", "academic careers": "[EDUCATIONAL_RECORD1]"}, "abstract_map": {"Karla Scott": "a researcher", "Hooks": "an author", "Black Communities": "cultural groups", "predominantly White communities": "majority cultural environments", "Black Women": "individuals from a specific cultural background", "women": "individuals", "Black": "a specific cultural identity", "twenty first century": "modern times", "academic careers": "educational journeys"}, "task_category": "Generating Non-Fictional Documents"}

I do have a better offer and the change to it is quite trivial these days. A plugin and some config and we are done. However I am comfortable with your platform, And would entertain an offer to keep me.\n\nThere is endless blood sweat and tears into the final result which is processing card payments.

{"index": 133, "conversation_id": "UzML2YK", "original_message": "generate 5W1H:\n\n\nSINGAPORE: African countries could use the ongoing rivalry between the United States and China to advance their own interests, with both global superpowers competing to expand their footprint in the continent, said analysts. \n\nTheir comments come as more than 40 African leaders gather in Washington this week for a key summit with the US. The meeting is said to be an effort to reset and improve US relations with Africa, with President Joe Biden looking to use personal diplomacy to win back influence. \n\n“China will say that it's not in competition with the United States, and the United States will say it's not in competition with China, but we do know that both are struggling for influence across the world,” said Dr Ebenezer Obadare, a Douglas Dillon senior fellow for Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \n\nChina is using the continent as a test run for all the other plans that it has, he told CNA’s World Tonight on Wednesday (Dec 14). \n\n“So China knows that if it's able to secure the interests of African countries, if it's able to increase the number of allies it has on the continent, that will help it in a strategic contest with the United States.”\n\nThe US is realising that “it is in no position to allow China to consolidate its toehold on the continent”, said Dr Obadare. “So if you look at it that way, from the point of view of Africa, it's a very, very good time. \n\n“African countries can leverage the competition to advance African interests. They can make requests of the United States that they probably wouldn't have made maybe in the last 10 years.”\n\nThe US and China have downplayed concerns of Africa turning into an area of competition.\n\nCHINESE INFLUENCE IN AFRICA\n\nChina has been a big player in Africa. It is the continent’s largest provider of foreign direct investment, pouring in roughly twice the amount of US funding.\n\nChina is also Africa’s biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching a record high of US$254 billion last year. The US pales in contrast in this aspect, recording US$64 billion.\n\n“It has a huge amount of ground to make up,” said George Washington University’s professorial lecturer David Shinn. \n\n“I would point out that most of China's trade with Africa is Chinese exports to Africa, not imports from Africa, whereas US-African trade is actually slightly in favour of the Africans.”\n\nThe former US ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso said the major reason for the decline in US-Africa trade is that “the US is not importing anywhere near the amount of oil that it once did from the continent”. \n\nBut some analysts believe the US is unlikely to use the ongoing US-Africa Leaders Summit to draw the African countries away from its competitors.\n\n“I think the United States is simply trying to improve its relations with African countries on their own merits,” Dr Shinn told CNA’s Asia First on Tuesday. \n\n“It's not doing it as direct competition with China, although that seems to be the approach that most are taking to the summit these days.”\n", "pii_dict": {"SINGAPORE": "GEOLOCATION", "African countries": "GEOLOCATION", "United States": "GEOLOCATION", "China": "GEOLOCATION", "Washington": "GEOLOCATION", "this week": "TIME", "Wednesday (Dec 14)": "TIME", "Dr Ebenezer Obadare": "NAME", "Council on Foreign Relations": "AFFILIATION", "CNA’s World Tonight": "AFFILIATION", "George Washington University": "AFFILIATION", "David Shinn": "NAME", "CNA’s Asia First": "AFFILIATION", "former US ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso": "AFFILIATION"}, "pii_count": 8, "variants_map": {"SINGAPORE": ["SINGAPORE"], "African countries": ["African countries", "Africa"], "United States": ["United States", "US"], "China": ["China"], "Washington": ["Washington"], "this week": ["this week"], "Wednesday (Dec 14)": ["Wednesday (Dec 14)"], "Dr Ebenezer Obadare": ["Dr Ebenezer Obadare"], "Council on Foreign Relations": ["Council on Foreign Relations"], "CNA’s World Tonight": ["CNA’s World Tonight"], "George Washington University": ["George Washington University"], "David Shinn": ["David Shinn"], "CNA’s Asia First": ["CNA’s Asia First"], "former US ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso": ["former US ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso"]}, "redact_map": {"SINGAPORE": "[GEOLOCATION1]", "African countries": "[GEOLOCATION2]", "United States": "[GEOLOCATION3]", "China": "[GEOLOCATION4]", "Washington": "[GEOLOCATION5]", "this week": "[TIME1]", "Wednesday (Dec 14)": "[TIME2]", "Dr Ebenezer Obadare": "[NAME1]", "Council on Foreign Relations": "[AFFILIATION1]", "CNA’s World Tonight": "[AFFILIATION2]", "George Washington University": "[AFFILIATION3]", "David Shinn": "[NAME2]", "CNA’s Asia First": "[AFFILIATION4]", "former US ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso": "[AFFILIATION5]"}, "abstract_map": {"SINGAPORE": "A Southeast Asian city-state", "African countries": "Nations on the African continent", "United States": "A North American country", "China": "A country in East Asia", "Washington": "The capital city of the United States", "this week": "a recent time period", "Wednesday (Dec 14)": "a specific day in December", "Dr Ebenezer Obadare": "a senior fellow for Africa studies", "Council on Foreign Relations": "an American think tank", "CNA’s World Tonight": "a news program", "George Washington University": "an American university", "David Shinn": "a professorial lecturer", "CNA’s Asia First": "a news segment", "former US ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso": "a previous diplomatic position"}, "task_category": "Information Retrieval"}

The Dutch trade minister has confirmed talks are ongoing.\n\nWennink said it seemed contradictory that U.S. chip manufacturers are able to sell their most advanced chips to Chinese customers, while ASML is only able to sell older chipmaking equipment.\n\"American chip manufacturers have no problem with China as a customer,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, \"it is common knowledge that chip technology for purely military applications is usually 10, 15 years old.

My twin daughters, Mavis Gruver and Nia Kelly were entering that turbulent time, and I wasn’t looking forward to it!\n\nUnable to find practical, accessible resources to help, I was inspired by the vision of a magazine for all girls who want their voices heard and their dreams taken seriously. I thought of it as a “junior Ms.” magazine.\n\nI brought this idea to Mavis &amp; Nia and their close friend Sarah. Their first response was underwhelming, to say the least), “What do you mean, ‘Start a Magazine?’ We don’t know how to do that!”\n\nBut when I changed the question to, “Would you want to read a magazine run by girls – where girls share their real lives and problems, their dreams and their challenges?,” their ideas started flowing fast.\n\nThen they recruited twenty friends to join the first Girls Editorial Board. These 20 girls worked together with me and my husband, Joe Kelly, in our living room and attic in Duluth, Minnesota, to invent the departments, themes, and features for the award-winning, ad-free New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams.\n\nIt set a new standard for high-quality media by and for tween and teen girls.  We were the first, and still the only, child-created publication to win the prestigious Association of Educational Publishers’ Golden Lamp award as the best U.S. children’s magazine.\n\nStrengthening Girls to Resist Popular Culture Propaganda\nIn today’s media-saturated and still-sexist times, girls are torn between what they dream for themselves and what society expects of them. Bombarded by “perfect girl” stereotypes and hyper-sexualized images, girls try to cope by taking their authentic voices underground and setting aside their earlier ambitions. In order to survive these pressures, they lose touch with themselves.\n\nBut there is hope! Research shows that girls can use emotional support, self-expression, and healthy resistance to stay deeply connected to their true interests, abilities, and hopes.\n\nOur members do this every day. They help each other express and value their unique talents in the pages of New Moon Girls magazine. They empathize and problem-solve with each other, learning how to connect meaningfully even when their lives, beliefs, and opinions may be very different.\n\nChanging Girls’ Lives for the Better\nOur members grow into young women who pursue their dreams and ambitions, even against heavy odds. We hear this every week from NMG alumni in their late teens, twenties, and beyond, who thank us for the unique community that was there for them when they needed help to stay true to themselves.\n\nThis is why I’m still passionately committed to reaching girls everywhere who need the inspiration, connection, and support that New Moon Girls brings.", "pii_dict": {"Mavis Gruver": "NAME", "Nia Kelly": "NAME", "Sarah": "NAME", "Joe Kelly": "NAME", "Duluth, Minnesota": "GEOLOCATION", "New Moon Girls": "AFFILIATION", "New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams": "AFFILIATION", "Association of Educational Publishers": "AFFILIATION", "1992": "TIME"}, "pii_count": 8, "variants_map": {"Mavis Gruver": ["Mavis Gruver"], "Nia Kelly": ["Nia Kelly"], "Sarah": ["Sarah"], "Joe Kelly": ["Joe Kelly"], "Duluth, Minnesota": ["Duluth, Minnesota"], "New Moon Girls": ["New Moon Girls"], "New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams": ["New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams"], "Association of Educational Publishers": ["Association of Educational Publishers"], "1992": ["1992"]}, "redact_map": {"Mavis Gruver": "[NAME1]", "Nia Kelly": "[NAME2]", "Sarah": "[NAME3]", "Joe Kelly": "[NAME4]", "Duluth, Minnesota": "[GEOLOCATION1]", "New Moon Girls": "[AFFILIATION1]", "New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams": "[AFFILIATION2]", "Association of Educational Publishers": "[AFFILIATION3]", "1992": "[TIME1]"}, "abstract_map": {"Mavis Gruver": "one of the author's twin daughters", "Nia Kelly": "the other twin daughter of the author", "Sarah": "a close friend of the author's daughters", "Joe Kelly": "the author's husband", "Duluth, Minnesota": "a city in the United States", "New Moon Girls": "a magazine for girls", "New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams": "a publication created for and by girls", "Association of Educational Publishers": "a professional organization for educational publications", "1992": "the early 1990s"}, "task_category": "Summarization"}

{"index": 161, "conversation_id": "yNwEGdi", "original_message": "Hi ChatGPT, please write me an application/statement. I will provide you with the information needed to so. The writing style should be formal but enthusiastic. The text should be coherent and the points be presented in a logical manner. Overall it should not exceed max 500 words.\nThe statement should introduce me, Kiarash Tebbi, a 25 year old master’s student of “Biological Sciences” of the “University of Cologne”. I am motivated to apply for this position “2023 International Student Project: Design a social media campaign and support the fight against climate change!” for two main reasons. One, because I consider myself an environmentalist. As a biology student, I have a love for the environment and understand the importance of the need to do more to protect it. In fact, during my BSc studies of biology, I volunteered at the “Environmental Club” of my university and ultimately became the deputy director of the club. Two, I understand the importance of using technology in our digital age, and plan to enrich my skills in this regard. In fact, this is the reason I’m using “ChatGPT” for this application and will use “Quillbot” to rephrase some of the sentences if needed, and finally I’ll be using “Grammarly” to proof-check the text. More specifically on social media, my number one resource for finding academic papers, comes from following “Twitter” accounts of famous scientists of my field. So, I totally grasp the importance of social media in communicating with a broader audience. Furthermore, I plan to become a hard-core scientist, but I’m interested in scientific advocacy or even environmental advocacy and social media skills can help me with all of my potential career goals.\nThe statement should also state what I can bring to the group. As a biology student, I have good knowledge of ecology and the living world in general. We should know what we want to protect right? I do have some previous experience with international courses. I’ve participated in two courses about biology of aging. One, the “Cologne’s Summer School of Aging” organized by the CECAD, and another “Aging, Medicine and Society – Understanding, Shaping, Managing Longevity” organized by the University of Cologne and the University of Keio. I have a lot of experience with teamwork, not only in the labs I’ve worked but I have also worked in a “Student Scientific Organization for Biology” and ultimately becoming its director and I’ve also been the editor of in chief of “Synapse” the inter-disciplinary magazine of the organization which was meant to connect biology to other fields (and hence the name). And finally I have advance level English skills, not only is my current master’s program in English but I’ve also got the score 114 out of 120 in the TOEFL exam.\n", "pii_dict": {"Kiarash Tebbi": "NAME", "25 year old": "AGE", "master’s student of “Biological Sciences”": "EDUCATIONAL_RECORD", "University of Cologne": "AFFILIATION", "2023": "TIME", "Environmental Club": "AFFILIATION", "ChatGPT": "AFFILIATION", "Quillbot": "AFFILIATION", "Grammarly": "AFFILIATION", "Twitter": "AFFILIATION", "Cologne’s Summer School of Aging": "AFFILIATION", "CECAD": "AFFILIATION", "University of Keio": "AFFILIATION", "Student Scientific Organization for Biology": "AFFILIATION", "Synapse": "AFFILIATION", "TOEFL": "EDUCATIONAL_RECORD", "score 114 out of 120": "FINANCIAL_INFORMATION"}, "pii_count": 8, "variants_map": {"Kiarash Tebbi": ["Kiarash Tebbi"], "25 year old": ["25 year old"], "master’s student of “Biological Sciences”": ["master’s student of “Biological Sciences”"], "University of Cologne": ["University of Cologne"], "2023": ["2023"], "Environmental Club": ["Environmental Club"], "ChatGPT": ["ChatGPT"], "Quillbot": ["Quillbot"], "Grammarly": ["Grammarly"], "Twitter": ["Twitter"], "Cologne’s Summer School of Aging": ["Cologne’s Summer School of Aging"], "CECAD": ["CECAD"], "University of Keio": ["University of Keio"], "Student Scientific Organization for Biology": ["Student Scientific Organization for Biology"], "Synapse": ["Synapse"], "TOEFL": ["TOEFL"], "score 114 out of 120": ["score 114 out of 120"]}, "redact_map": {"Kiarash Tebbi": "[NAME1]", "25 year old": "[AGE1]", "master’s student of “Biological Sciences”": "[EDUCATIONAL_RECORD1]", "University of Cologne": "[AFFILIATION1]", "2023": "[TIME1]", "Environmental Club": "[AFFILIATION2]", "ChatGPT": "[AFFILIATION3]", "Quillbot": "[AFFILIATION4]", "Grammarly": "[AFFILIATION5]", "Twitter": "[AFFILIATION6]", "Cologne’s Summer School of Aging": "[AFFILIATION7]", "CECAD": "[AFFILIATION8]", "University of Keio": "[AFFILIATION9]", "Student Scientific Organization for Biology": "[AFFILIATION10]", "Synapse": "[AFFILIATION11]", "TOEFL": "[EDUCATIONAL_RECORD2]", "score 114 out of 120": "[FINANCIAL_INFORMATION1]"}, "abstract_map": {"Kiarash Tebbi": "an applicant", "25 year old": "a young adult", "master’s student of “Biological Sciences”": "a graduate student in a scientific field", "University of Cologne": "a renowned European university", "2023": "the current year", "Environmental Club": "a university environmental organization", "ChatGPT": "an AI language model", "Quillbot": "a paraphrasing tool", "Grammarly": "a writing assistant tool", "Twitter": "a social media platform", "Cologne’s Summer School of Aging": "a specialized summer program", "CECAD": "a research center", "University of Keio": "a Japanese university", "Student Scientific Organization for Biology": "a student-led scientific group", "Synapse": "an interdisciplinary magazine", "TOEFL": "an English proficiency test", "score 114 out of 120": "a high score"}, "task_category": "Generating Non-Fictional Documents"}

Hawaii consistently ranks as one of the most expensive places to live in the United States, with high prices for housing, food, and transportation. San Diego, while still expensive, is generally more affordable than Hawaii. “You would need around $7,546 in Honolulu, HI to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with $7,300 in San Diego, CA”. (Numbeo) From my personal experience this is true, while I have noticed that you can find more affordable housing in Hawaii than in San Diego, the cost of food is significantly higher. Also, at least on the island I live on, a car is a necessity.
