Amazon Prime is a classic example of this and was recently approved for IAP.\nMultiple apps have launched or are planning to launch memberships programs, where the purchase of the membership is de-coupled from the purchase of the actual product or service.

Lyft has told us they will pursue a full-scale launch as early as next month.\nWe introduced a framework for how to think about monetization on the App Store in it’s current state…and how it might look like in the future (page 2&amp;3). We believe Membership Subscriptions can become a key lever to monetize some of the most popular free apps.\nIn addition to the apps that currently have membership subscriptions (e.g. Postmates, Costco, and Instacart) there are many additional apps that could benefit from a membership subscription (e.g. Nordstrom, Alibaba, Ticketmaster, etc). Our team would like to proactively pitch these partners to offer membership subscriptions and to discuss the benefits of IAP, once our policy is official.\nMany of these developers recognize the benefits of using our subscriptions platform, particularly as a way to launch and operationalize these memberships quickly.
